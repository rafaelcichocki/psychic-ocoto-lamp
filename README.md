# Project
Calendar Task App

* navigate to different months and years
* view day/week/month
* CRUD Tasks
* Modal view: Create/Edit, Start/End day/time
* saved in data store / DB

## Further thoughts
* Authentication
* Inviting others to events


## Questions
* Task vs event?



# Interviewing Tool Feedback
* Look at task, and then time is already running? What if I want to work on it at a later point in time?
* What are criteria for success? How much am I expected to achieve?

Huge project definition but usable if:
* tell beforehand that project will be greenfield so that candidate can prep favourite stack and boilerplate
* tell what to focus on (styling, state, reusable components, services, tests, ...)
* tell that project is incompletable - just choose 1 feature from it and try to do it as fully as possible in 4h?


# Nextjs boilerplate

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
